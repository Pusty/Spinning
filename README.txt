Hello to everyone reading this README file!
This is the source of my game "Spinning".
I made it for Mini Ludum Dare 62 which had the Theme Final Boss.
Everything (except the font) was made within less then 24h! Without a code base!
Well I don't think anyone is reading this but if someone is reading this
and wants to know if you are allowed to use anything in this: yes!
Thanks for your time
